# Pi_Pico_Battleships

The project implements wireless communication between multiple Raspberry Pi Pico devices using Wi-Fi. All Pico units connect to a central Pico that manages the entire transmission process. The central device operates as a DHCP server, assigns IP addresses, and coordinates data exchange between nodes. It receives data from individual devices and forwards it to the appropriate recipients. The system is implemented entirely in C.
